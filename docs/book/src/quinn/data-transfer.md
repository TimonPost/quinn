# Data Transfer

In the [previous chapter](set-up-connection.md) we characterized how to set up an [Endpoint][Endpoint]
and then get access to a [NewConnection][NewConnection] instance.
Now we will continue with the subject of sending data over this connection.

## Multiplexing

A QUIC stream can be compared to a TCP stream, eventhough if it is based on UDP. 
The big difference is that you are not limited to a single stream. 
You can open multiple streams between two peers, this is also called multiplexing.

Stream multiplexing can have a significant positive effect on application performance if the resources allocated to streams are properly prioritized.
Currently it is used in a protocol like HTTP/2, but unlike HTTP multiplexing, QUIC does not automatically multiplexing data.
This is an advantage because the user gets full control over the multiplexing. 
In addition, QUIC is not limited to one kind of stream but can open both bidirectional and unidirectional streams.
 
## Stream Types

Quinn offers three ways to send your data. 
Two stream-based and one message-based.

| Type | Description | Reference |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Bidirectional Stream** | two way stream communication. | see [open_bi][open_bi] |
| **Unidirectional Stream** | one way stream communication. | see [open_uni][open_uni] |
| **Unreliable Messaging** | message based unreliable communication. | see [send_datagram][send_datagram] |

Soon we will discuss this in more detail.

## How to Use

You can open a new stream or read from an existing stream of data.
New streams can be created with the methods [open_bi][open_bi], [open_uni][open_uni] from [Connection][Connection] type.
An instance of this type is found in the [connection][connection] field of [NewConnection][NewConnection]. 
This [NewConnection][NewConnection] stores existing streams as well. Lets look at some examples:

*Iterate over various opened streams*

```rust
async fn iterate_streams(mut connection: NewConnection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Iterate unidirectional streams with only the receiving side.
    while let Some(Ok(recv)) = connection.uni_streams.next().await { }
    // Iterate bidirectional streams with both sent and receiving side.
    while let Some(Ok((sent, recv))) = connection.bi_streams.next().await { }
    // Iterate arrived datagrams.
    while let Some(Ok(bytes)) = connection.datagrams.next().await { }

    Ok(())
}
```

*Open different types of streams*

```rust
async fn open_streams(mut connection: Connection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Open unidirectional stream.
    let mut send = connection.
        open_uni()
        .await?;

    // Open bidirectional stream.
    let (send, recv) = connection.
        open_bi()
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Bidirectional Streams

With bidirectional streams you can carry data in both directions, for example, from the initiator to the peer and in reverse.
 
*open bidirectional stream*

```rust
async fn open_bidirectional_stream(connection: Connection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let (mut send, recv) = connection.
        open_bi()
        .await?;

    send.write_all(b"test").await?;
    send.finish().await?;
    
    let received = recv.read_to_end(10).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

*iterate bidirectional stream(s)*

```rust
async fn receive_bidirectional_stream(mut connection: NewConnection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    while let Some(Ok((sent, recv))) = connection.bi_streams.next().await {
        // Because it is a bidirectional stream, we can both sent and recieve.
        println!("request: {:?}", recv.read_to_end(50).await?);

        send.write_all(b"response").await?;
        send.finish().await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## Unidirectional Streams 

With unidirectional streams, you can carry data only in one direction, for example, from the initiator of the stream to its peer.
    
*open unidirectional stream*

```rust
async fn open_unidirectional_stream(connection: Connection)-> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut send = connection.
        open_uni()
        .await?;

    send.write_all(b"test").await.unwrap();
    send.finish().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

*iterating unidirectional stream(s)*

```rust
async fn receive_unidirectional_stream(mut connection: NewConnection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    while let Some(Ok(recv)) = connection.uni_streams.next().await {
        // Because it is a unidirectional stream, we can only receive not sent back.
        println!("{:?}", recv.read_to_end(50).await?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## Unreliable Messaging

With unreliable messaging you can transfer data [unreliable][unreliable] over bare UDP.

*send datagram*

```rust
async fn sent_unreliable(connection: Connection)-> anyhow::Result<()> {
    connection.
        send_datagram(b"test".into())
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

*iterating datagram stream(s)*

```rust
async fn receive_datagram(mut connection: NewConnection) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    while let Some(Ok(receivedBytes)) = connection.datagrams.next().await {
        // Because it is a unidirectional stream, we can only receive not sent back.
        println!("request: {:?}", received);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
