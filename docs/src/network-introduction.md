# Networking Introduction

The Internet is unreliable, it changes every second, cables can be cut, network congestion can occur, packets can become corrupted, etc. 
As soon as we send a packet, it can take any road to reach its destination. 
To assure the end-user of certain transmission guarantees, such as the arrival of parcels, specific protocols are defined.  

There are some established protocols such as TCP, UDP which are supported by all routers, firewalls, servers, and operating systems. 
Although these protocols are well accepted, this does not mean that they are perfect or serve all areas of interest. 
QUIC is being created to solve the problems of the modern Internet and the TCP protocol.

In the next chapter we will take a closer look at the various protocols, their transmission guarantees, and areas of interest.
